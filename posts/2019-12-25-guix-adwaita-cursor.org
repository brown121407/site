#+TITLE: Use Adwaita cursors in the GNU Guix System
#+DATE: <2019-12-25 Wed>

One of the problems I had with Guix was that the default cursors were too small for my display. They didn't scale. But I knew Adwaita did.

To get Adwaita cursors in your Guix system, first install the ~adwaita-icon-theme~ package. 

After that, link ~$HOME/.guix-profile/share/icons/~ to ~$HOME/.icons~.

Add the following line in ~$HOME/.Xresources~:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
Xcursor.theme: Adwaita
#+END_SRC

Then reload the X resources database:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
xrdb -merge .Xresources
#+END_SRC

And reload your WM. That should be it, if I recall correctly.

If it doesn't work, [[mailto:brown121407@member.fsf.org][send me an email]] and I'll look into it to see what I missed.
