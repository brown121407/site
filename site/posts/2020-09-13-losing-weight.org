#+TITLE: Losing weight

Perhaps you've noticed already that this website is pretty
ligthweight, at least compared to other, more "modern" ones. I decided
to take this one step further and stop serving Roboto as the custom
font for those pages.

From now on your load times will be increased and your bandwidth (and
mine) will suffer no more the burden of transporting the impressive
167 KB of the TTF file. Though your browser was probably caching it
and it isn't that big of a deal, I think it's a good decision
nonetheless.

Most browsers allow you to change your fonts. If you think to yourself
that the writing on those pages looks kinda ugly, maybe it's time to
finally settle on some good looking fonts that *you* prefer for all
three families: serif, sans-serif and monospace.

Have fun!
