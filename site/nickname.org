#+TITLE: Why this nickname?
#+DATE: <2020-09-15 Tue 19:54>

About three years ago I found a weird error log posted on Stack
Overflow that contained "brown 121407" in it and I thought it sounded
interesting and was random enough that I would like it.

And the big ass number at the end also guarantees that the nickname is
not taken wherever I use it, which is nice.
