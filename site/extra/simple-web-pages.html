			<P id="first">
				We forgot what it's like to have simple web pages that we can just throw
				around.
			</P>

			<P>
				Try going to one of the sites you like, find an interesting article and
				download it. If it's a <Q>popular</Q> site, there's a big chance it's
				either going to look like shit or not even work when you open your local
				copy. And I'm not thinking about The New York Times' website, I'm
				talking about <Q>normal</Q> people's stuff. I have seen enough blogs
				built with JavaScript frameworks to know we're really fucked.
			</P>

			<P>
				<Q>But who cares?</Q> you might ask. <Q>Everyone has unlimited internet
				and we're used to firing up monolithic web browsers that need the
				energy of a nuclear power plant just to render a cat picture. No one
				downloads web pages anymore, old man!</Q>
			</P>

			<P>
				And you are not wrong. Not many people care and <Q>everyone</Q> is used to
				the way we do stuff now, even if we don't have the greatest system. You can
				see this type of mentality all over the world regarding almost every
				problem: from tech to economics.
			</P>

			<P>
				Let's be a bit adventurous and... think! Just for a minute. I promise it
				won't hurt (too much). Why would someone want to download a web page?
				Why would you want to have an article not encumbered by 200 megabytes of
				JavaScript to properly render 10 paragraphs of text? Why should a page
				just be readable by default?
			</P>

			<P>
				Some people use custom plugins or browser settings because of
				accessibilty reasons and if you clutter your pages with whatever shit
				you think <I>looks cool</I> it may make their experience a lot worse.
			</P>

			<P>
				Some people maybe live in the middle of nowhere and have slow or no
				internet, but they come to town once a week and download all the
				interesting stuff they find so they can read it on the farm. Others may
				be on metered connections and, if I were them, I would be really pissed
				off if I had to pay for downloading a tens of megabytes of junk just to
				read a thousand words.
			</P>

			<P>
				Some people may really like your ideas, but prefer sticking their eyes
				out for hours at a paper, not a screen, so they usually print
				interesting articles.
			</P>

			<P>
				We have the technology to make every kind of reader happy, we just need
				to be motivated enough to use it.
			</P>

			<P>
				A lot of the (useful) information on the web is in text form.  The base
				format for the web, the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is great for
				describing the elements of a document. It knows what's a paragraph, how
				to put emphasis, how to quote, how to insert images, a lot of great
				stuff. That means that if you're only going to do some writing with
				maybe a bit of graphics, your project should end up great and very
				accessible for the web. Hell, you can even put some of your artistic
				self in it by playing with some Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
			</P>

			<P>
				If you want to put out information that's mostly text-based (as you'll
				often find yourself wanting to do, if you're not a YouTuber or TikToker
				of whatever kids do those days), we can see that <Q>traditional</Q> web
				methods sound great. All you have to do is write a document and upload
				it to a server. There are a lot of great places that offer free hosting
				for static sites (no server-side work being done), like 
				<A href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</A>, for example.
			</P>

			<P>
				You don't necessarily need to put it online, if you don't want to. If
				you write, for example, a book in an HTML file, you can just send it to
				your friends over email. Nowadays everyone has a web browser (and even
				if they are huge nerds that categorically refuse to use
				<Q>mainstream</Q> stuff such as Google Chrome or Firefox, I'm sure they
				still use IceCat, w3m, links, eww or other less-known browsers). All you need to
				view a rendered HTML file is one of those.
			</P>

			<P>
				Writing a web page to send to your friends is also a lot better than
				sending them a Word document. Web pages weigh a lot less than
				Microsoft's proprietary format (or even its libre counterparts, like
				LibreOffice). Web pages don't require licenses to be opened; there are
				enough browsers in the world and a good deal of them are free software
				too, so you can send someone a HTML file without worrying if they <I>can
				afford</I> the program they need to open it and if they will get their
				data mined in the process. You may want to allow the recipient to use their own
				fonts, to enlarge or shrink the text &mdash; things you can not do with some of
				the other document formats, like PDF, which have other advantages.
			</P>

			<P>
				Talking specifically about sending documents to your peers, if the exact
				layout matters, and you need to have graphs, pictures, tables etc., PDFs
				sound like the better choice. If you want to write a light essay (like
				this one) with a bit of styling here and there or you need multiples
				documents that are interlinked, HTML documents fit well. PDFs are
				more convenient for sending as they are a single file, even when they
				have images in them.
			</P>

			<P>
				But if you want to have it hosted on the internet, no one stops you from
				embedding pictures, videos, tables or whatever you want in an HTML
				document. Those will be served automatically and the user doesn't need
				to worry about them.
			</P>

			<P>
				Writing an occasional article means you don't need a complicated
				Wordpress setup with some fancy theme that you think is really cool
				because it has the navigation links visible only when you hover some
				weird portion of the top bar.
			</P>

			<P>
				If you're trying to spread information that you consider useful,
				definitely don't clutter your web page, but if you really want to take a
				dump on it, don't do it with advertisments. There's not one sane person
				on this earth that loves having to swim through tens of colorful gifs
				trying to convince them to buy a product or use a service from dirty
				corporation when they just try to read whatever the hell you wrote. Some
				people won't even bother reading your stuff anymore if you treat them
				like a potential click-through statistic on your analytics dashboard.
			</P>

			<P>
				You also don't need complicated tooling to write a good website.  This
				document was written using plain, old Vim. No plugins, not even a config
				file, really. This is proof that what you need is only basic knowledge
				of HTML and a text editor. The text editor is the simplest to obtain:
				your operating system probably comes with one already, be it Vim, nano,
				Gedit or even Notepad. If not, the internet is full of information about
				how to install one. You can learn to write the HTML code needed to
				format a simple document in under an hour. The most important things
				you'll want to learn are formatting elements: paragraphs, bold, italic
				and underlined text, quoting, links.
			</P>

			<P>
				Your browser probably has an option to view the source of a webpage in
				one of it's menus &mdash; you can use that to look at this page's source
				code. Alternatively, you can just download it and open the file in your
				favourite editor and play with it.
			</P>

			<P>
				Note that even if this website is itself a simple one, you <I>don't have
				to</I> make yours as ugly as this one, and <I>neither do you have to</I>
				write it by hand. There are lots of methods for generating websites,
				such as the millions of static site generators that exist out there. My
				personal blog itself is generated using a bunch of Emacs Lisp and the
				content itself is written in Org, but the results are clean pages that
				don't burn the entire Amazon forest only by loading in Chrome <I>and</I>
				look better than this document. Nevertheless, I encourage everyone to
				typeset an essay direcly in HTML from time to time. It's easire than it
				sounds and it's a refreshing experience.
			</P>

			<P>
				The point is that if you want to write a <I>document</I> intended for
				<I>reading</I>, you should make it as readable and as easy to share as
				possible. You won't pass around a Word document, but, instead, you would
				send a PDF. You won't use whatever new hot JavaScript framework is
				trending on Hackernews and Reddit to create a website that only needs to
				convey some static information, but, instead, you would write it either
				in HTML or in a simple format (like Markdown or Org) that generates
				clean and lightweight pages.
			</P>

			<P>
				Don't think about what it would be <I>cool</I> to do on your documents
				if you mostly want to just share information.  Try to reason about what
				would make the reading experience most pleasant.
			</P>

			<HR>

			<H2>TLDR</H2>
			<P>
				If you just want to publish an article or book on the web, make it as
				easy as possible to be read, downloaded and, eventually, printed (some
				people's eyes hurt from looking at screens all day, you know?).
