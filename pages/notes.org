I don't know what I'll write here. It seems like half the stuff I thought I'll put here is going into the "Reminders & ideas" section of [[./extra.org][Extra]], the second half in posts and the third, I'm not allowed to talk about it here yet cause it may get me expelled from school if they find this site.
