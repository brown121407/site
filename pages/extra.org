Here I keep anything else that doesn't go in a post but I still want to have in my corner of the internet.

* My other websites
- [[https://temple.121407.xyz][TempleOS website mirror]] 

* TODO Reminders & ideas [0/8]
- [ ] Generate an RSS feed.
- [ ] Clean this list sometime in the future.
- [ ] Write post about Doom Emacs.
- [ ] Finish some of my projects and find a way to sell them (as libre software, of course).
- [ ] Write post about using proprietary crapware in Romanian schools and the Information and Communication Technology curriculum and exam.
- [ ] Write post about my love for free software.
- [ ] "Without Facebook you don't exist"
- [ ] Add a folder with all my books and link them nicely. (MUST DO -- I collected over 100 cool books about math & computer science stuff just in the last week).
