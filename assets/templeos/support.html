      Currently <a href="https://github.com/trapexit">trapexit</a> is maintaining <a href="https://templeos.org">templeos.org</a>. The domain, the <a href="https://cockbox.org">server</a>, the website, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/TerryADavis_TempleOS_Archive">archives</a>. The VPS currently used has been donated but the costs for domain registration, archive storage and maintaince, etc. are out of pocket. If there is an interest in dedicated video streaming (we keep getting kicked off platforms due to Terry's language and nudity), dedicated archive serving, etc. we'll likely need to raise funds to cover the costs.
